- formatting is too aggressive. My "TODO" comments are constantly forced away from functions and type definitions
- many JS APIs are not available in Elm (e.g. String.localCompare)
- Messages are separated from model, but many messages only make sense when model is an a certain state, which requires checking and creates a potential for runtime errors
- Initial prototyping went super fast and easy, but adding routing and JS interop took some mind bending
- Using navkey at the root of the model is polluting the model
- Focusing elements using Cmd is very annoying, pollutes update methods with unnecessary dom-related code
